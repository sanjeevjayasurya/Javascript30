    const str1 = "Sanjeev"
    const str2 = str1

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const players2 = players
    console.log(players1, players2)
    // however what happens when we update that array?
    players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Sanjeev', 'Poppy']
    // now here is the problem!
    console.log(players1,players2)
    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!
    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    // one way
    const team2 = players.slice()
    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team3 = [].concat(players)
    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team4 = [...players]
    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed
    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    const captain = person
    captain.name = 'Sanjeev'
    console.log(person, captain) // gives the same output 
    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const person2 =  Object.assign({}, person,{number:22, age:22}) // shallow cloning
    console.log(person2)
    const obj = {
      name:'Sanjeev',
      age: 22,
      social: {
        twitter: '@sanjeev',
        instagram: '@criplindepression'
      }
    }
    // To deep clone we use:
    const deepClonedObj = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(obj))
